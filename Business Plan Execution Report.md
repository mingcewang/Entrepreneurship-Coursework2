Introduction 

Part a and b

Our business is focused on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help streamline the job market. We currently offer one product, an app called Part Time Job Matching. Our app uses an intelligent recommendation system based on reinforcement learning, to learn the job seekers preferences and behaviour to provide a more tailored job search process. Employers can also advertise on our app for no cost, and find suitable talent tailored for their roles.

Our primary objectives with Part Time Job Matching are to help solve the big demand for part-time job opportunities in the UK, help employers find the right talent for a given role, and streamline the job seeking process for part time workers in the UK. In our business plan you will see how our product achieves all these objectives; with the way we have our designed our product. These objectives were a part of our philosophy when we were designing our product, and we believe our solution in its current form is the best way forward for both job seekers and employers. 

+ Overall targets or goals and the dates we which to complete by

   Our product has two types of customers. Our first type of customer are job seekers looking for part time work across the UK, whether it is the unemployed or people looking for an extra job to earn some money. These two types of customers are all split between various industries that specialize in certain skills. These two groups should be able to identify themselves easily, as we have made it clear that our product is strictly aimed at the part time job market. Furthermore, our product has the capability to differentiate the specific set of skills that each job seeker has. So, we believe that customers will have no issues identifying themselves and seeing if the product is relevant for them. Another type of customer are businesses looking for job seekers to apply for roles and hire workers. Whether it is global business who operate in the UK or local businesses looking for part time workers. This type of customer should easily be able to identify themselves and since there are no costs for businesses to advertise on our site, they should be attracted to our offerings as well. Our product also helps stop workers from applying to jobs they are not qualified for with our recommendation system making it easier for recruiters in these businesses to handle the workload they may face when posting a job role on our site. Both these types of customers are welcome to use our product, and we have made it easier on both fronts with our usage of Artificial Intelligence.

Job seekers face numerous issues when looking for all types of work and product helps alleviate most of them. One hurdle they may face is difficulty finding a suitable position given the certain skills they may have. There are multiple factors for this being a competitive job market, not being aware of potential opportunities and a mismatch between available roles and a job seekers qualification. Our product helps minimize theses issue with its recommendation system based on reinforcement learning, so job seekers will be aware of all suitable job roles based on their skills at any time. If a job seeker wants to broaden their search, they can add more skills outside their ability to even see roles that may not be 100% suited for them, this can help at times when the job market is very competitive. So, our product helps get over this hurdle that potential part time workers may face. Another barrier that job seekers may face is overwhelming job search process. There are many steps to this issue whether it is the interview process being multiple stages, writing cover letters and researching companies. While our product can not solve these issues directly it can make it easier for job seekers to not be burnt out navigating pages of job roles that may not be suitable for them. Our main feature is the intelligent recommendation system which helps browsing through job roles much less tedious for the job seeker as they will only be recommended roles that suited for them. It is more in depth than a regular search function on a job board and we will not place sponsored ads by companies on our page making it much easier to navigate than other job boards. Hence, we can help overcome potential burnout that job seekers may face when looking for work.

On the other hand, the issues that the employers face are inherently due to hiring practices that a certain employer relies on.  While our product can not solve all these issues completely it can help alleviate a few of them. Streamlining the hiring process is a key area in which our product can help with but not completely solve. The hiring process can require interviews and assessments, and both things can be scheduled with the job seeker via our in-app chat system. To be clear this is not a feature unique to us, but some job boards do not have this functionality and rely solely on email. In the potential case a job seeker does not see an email from a recruiter our app will have notifications to always alert the job seeker when the recruiter is contacting them. Finding the right talent can also be an issue that employers face, looking for the person with the right set of skills and ethos can be difficult. Due to the way our product is designed we believe that recruiters will see a greater influx of suitable talent due to the nature of our recommendation system. Job seekers will only see roles that are suitable with their given set of skills and apply for them at their own will. Hence, helping filter out applications that are a poor fit for their given set of skills, and further reducing potential time wasted. 

Conclusion  
Part Time Job Matching aims to streamline the job market for both businesses and job seekers and help remedy the issues that both sides face when operating in the market. Our product is considered ‘high risk’ by the government for its usage of AI, but it operates fairly within current UK legislation, and we will continue to ensure it operates fairly for businesses that reside in other parts of the world but also operate in the UK.
 
By now you should have a clear idea of how our product works and how we plan to deliver it to the job market, with our research done on the recruitment and job market in the UK we have a clear vision of how our startup is going to succeed and hopefully we can get past the hurdles in the short run and be able to operate in the long run. ‘We ourselves cannot apply using Part Time Job Matching because we work full time on our business that empowers part time job seekers and employers across the UK’.

Part c

 What is the product that will meet the needs (value proposition)?
 
Our product is a part-time job matching platform that connects local employers with suitable candidates based on their skills, availability, and location. While this approach is effective for many modern service sectors, a recent interview with a long-established barbershop in Bath—New Saville Row, operating since 1965—highlighted a crucial insight: traditional industries like barbering value not only the presence of manpower but also the quality and specificity of skills.
The barbershop expressed that they experience staffing shortages during peak times but still prefer walk-in applicants with CVs. The reason is that barbering is a hands-on profession requiring precise scissor work—skills that are often not well taught in technical schools, which focus mainly on electric clippers. Moreover, the owner emphasized that face-to-face trials are essential to evaluate a candidate’s true ability. This feedback indicates that our product, in order to serve traditional skilled industries effectively, must go beyond standard digital matching.

To meet these needs, our value proposition includes:

Customizable job posting features where employers can request specific skills (e.g., scissor cutting, wet shaving), upload requirements, or require certifications.

A portfolio system for applicants to upload videos or photos of past work, making their abilities more visible and credible.

Experience-based filters allowing businesses to indicate whether they accept beginners or require prior experience.

An optional trial shift booking system, letting employers invite shortlisted applicants for a paid trial before making a final decision.

By implementing these features, we bridge the gap between digital recruitment and the practical, skill-driven expectations of traditional employers. Our product is not only a tool for job matching but also a platform that promotes skill transparency and trust, helping ensure the right fit between job seekers and businesses—especially in industries where craftsmanship matters.

Part d

How will your product meet the needs? That is, how does it work? This is where you demonstrate the features of your product and explain them.

Our product using nature language processing engine from spaCy combing with reinforcement learning to provide a unique customise job recommendation, this full fill various needs of users. To achieve this there are 5 main steps:

1. Automated Information Extraction

The NLP engine analyses 2 types of information, which are resumes and job description. Focusing on resume part, in a single resume there will normally be 3 parts skills, education and experience. 

It scans through the resume and searching for keywords such as Python, Java and SQL, which represent the potential employee’s skills. Then it extracts keywords from sentences which related to education, retrieve the part includes “university….”, “bachelor” and others. Afterwards it will continue searching for sentences which describe candidates’ working experiences. For Job description, it works as the same as in searching resume. It detects the skills the job demands for required skills and gather information from sentence indicating experience or term requirements. It also searches for time related terms to determine the working hours or other possible schedule.
The automated information extraction reduces the manual data processing’s workload, which helps to accurate matches for both job posting and candidate profiles.

3. Personal state representation

In this part, our system includes a “state vector” for each user to submit their preferences, includes:
Preferred salary range.
Job location the user fancy .
Working hours which align with user’s time preference.
Expertise and associated weights, the associated weights indicate the importance of each skill.
The system also records the number of jobs viewed, applied for and completed by each user. And keeps giving active average feedback for applications success rates. The personal state representation captures each users’ unique favour and history records, it helps on job recommendations to individual preferences and interactions, increasing the job recommendation relevance.

Multi-Factor Matching and Scoring
This function is a matching algorithm, it computes similarity scores between the candidate’s resume and each job postings. These are the main factors effecting the evaluation:
Skills matching: Compares the candidate skills with the job’s required skills, consider the proportion and importance of overlapping skills on both sides.
Location matching: It checks the job’s where abouts with candidates’ preferred location to work; also supports remote working and calculating semantic similarity of location phrases using NLP.
Time matching: Analyse if a job’s working schedule would overlap with a candidate’s expected working hours, this makes sure the arrangement of working full fills customer’s needs.
Salary matching: It determines a job’s salary meets a candidate’s expectation, also has a mechanism for circumstances such as higher or lower than expectation. When it is above the expectation, the match score is closer to 1.0; if it’s slightly higher, the ratio gets smaller, keeping the match in the 0.8 – 1.0 range. If the offered salary is much lower than expectations, it will reduce the overall salary match score.
The factors are weighted according to preset weights, for example skills 40%, location 30%, time 20% and salary 10%, as a result in a composite similarity score.
In this part we break down the matching process into multiple factors, so that the product can make sure it considers every aspect of those above factor then matching with related jobs.

Job value calculation
This section illustrates how our system calculates a total value for each candidate jobs and use it for the basis for recommendation and ranking.
4.1 Function description
Our target is the combined value of the job to the user is calculated by combining the match between the job and the user's preferences (π) and the immediate and delayed rewards of the user for different behaviours of the job, this can be noted as:

The higher the “Total Value” means that this job is more attractive and potentially rewarding the position is to the user.

4.2 How to calculate total value?

4.2.1 Calculating Personalised Interest π

First call function calculate_similarity(job, user.userpreference) to get a match score π between 0 and 1. This score combines the four dimensions of skill, location, time and salary to reflect how well the job fits the user's preferences.

4.2.2 Predict user actions

Next, predict_user_actions(user, job, user_history) is executed, which returns a dictionary probs containing probability values for various behaviours that the user may take with respect to the job, such as browsing (view), saving (save), applying (apply), ignoring (ignore), rejecting (reject), interviewing (interview), receiving an offer (job_offer), completing the job (complete), and leaving early (resign). 

4.2.3 Calculating immediate reward

Immediate rewards are calculated with preset weights based on the probability of different behaviours in the probs:  
Behaviour	Symbol	Weight	Description  
Browse	view	+0.1	User clicks to view post details  
Save	save	+0.3	User bookmarks the job.  

apply	apply	+0.5	user initiated the application  
Ignore	ignore	-0.1	User skips or slides over the job  
reject	reject	-0.3	User explicitly states that they are not interested in the job  


4.2.4 Calculating delayed reward  
As the same as immediate reward, the predicted probability of subsequent behaviour was used to calculate higher levels of delayed reward:  
Getting an interview (interview) +1.0  
Receiving an offer (job_offer) +2.0  
Completing the job (complete) +3.0  
Leaving the job early (resign) -1.0  
4.2.5 Applying a discount factor γ  
In order to balance short-term gains with long-term outcomes, the delayed reward is multiplied by a discount factor γ (here 0.8) so that the value of the behaviour is attenuated the further away it is.
In the end add the immediate reward to the discounted delayed reward and multiply by the match π to get the combined expected value of the position to the user.  
4.3  Application in the recommendation process    
In the actual recommendation, the system generates a ‘final_score’ for each position, which combines three pieces of information:  
Q-value (historical learning) - reflects the system's ‘confidence’ or ‘familiarity’ with the job based on the user's past behaviour;  
Total job value (job_value) - a composite value calculated in real-time that combines the match and the user's short/long term benefits;  
Base similarity (π) - the raw match between the job and the user's preferences.  
A fixed exploration factor ε (e.g. 0.2) is set in order to balance ‘exploitation’ of existing experience with ‘exploration’ of new opportunities. The general idea of the recommendation algorithm is:  
4.3.1 Getting the Q-value  
The system first reads the Q-value of the state-action pair from the Q-table based on the current user state (preference + interaction history) and the corresponding action index of the job.  
The higher the Q-value, the more positive the user's feedback on the job in the past, and the more ‘confident’ the system is about the job.  
4.3.2 Getting the total value of a job  
Calculate the real-time value of the job by using calculate_job_value(), which already integrates match, immediate reward and delayed reward.  
4.3.3 Get the base similarity  
This is the π value returned by calculate_similarity(), which is used as a reference when short-circuiting to explore new jobs.  
4.3.4 Combine all three with the exploration factor to calculate the final score  
If the Q value is greater than 0 (meaning that the system already has some interaction history), then the priority is to refer to the Q value (which is about 70%) and the total value of the post (which is about 30%), plus the ε part of the base similarity, the vast majority of the weight is allocated to the use of historical experience, a small portion of the weight is allocated to the real-time value of the position, and a proportion of ε is set aside for exploration.
If the Q value is equal to 0 (new position or no history yet), the total value of the position is directly used as the core (as a proportion of 1 - ε), and the remaining ε part relies on the base similarity to ensure that a reasonable amount of exploration can be done for new positions as well.

4.3.5 Sort and recommend  
Sort all available jobs according to final_score from highest to lowest, get the top N jobs with the highest scores, and display them to users.

5. Adaptive Reinforcement Learning  
The main part of the system is a Q-learning framework, the Q-learning algorithm maintains a Q-table, in each cell of the table corresponding to an expected reward Q for recommending or interacting with a specific job based on the user’s profile and historical behaviour.   
5.1 State and Actions:  
States represent the user’s context, such as their preferred salary range, skills weights, location choices and average feedback scores.
Actions typically correspond to recommending a specific job out of the available pool.

5.2 Rewards and Feedback:  
After the system recommends a job, the user’s behaviour generates feedback in the form of view, save, apply, ignore, feedback score. Each of these user actions is translated into a reward, positive for desired actions like applying or giving good feedback, negative if the job is ignored or rejected.
These rewards drive the Q-value updates and pushing the system to recommend more relevant jobs in the future.

5.3 Q – value updates:  
Our system uses a simplified Q- learning update equation:  
 
Q old is the existing Q-value for a given pair (state and action pair).
r is the instant reward received from the user’s interaction. For example, 0.5 for applying to a job.
α (learning rate) determines how quickly new information overrides the old evaluation.
This process is repeated for each user interaction and refining the Q-table. 

Exploration and Exploitation:  
In order to balance both exploitation and exploration, an exploration factor can be introduced when calculating final recommendation scores. This can make sure the system occasionally presents jobs with less historical data, potentially uncovering better jobs for the user.  

Continuous Learning:  
With more users interact within the system or as one same user continuing on applying or ignoring jobs, the Q- table moves closer to a strategy that maximises long-term returns. In practice, this means that the system learns more and more about which jobs the user is most likely to be actively engaged in, so it can provide more accurate and personalised recommendations over time.  

6. Friendly and clear web interface  
For our product prototype, we have a Django based website to display key functions.  
Job Recommendations: It shows a list of job opportunities based on user’s profile information.
Job Details and Interactions: This allows users to check the recommended job’s descriptions and make actions to each job. ( Actions are view, apply, save, give feedback)
Instant feedback capture: Every time when a user acts it will be recorded lively. At the same time a feedback  mechanism makes sure that the recommender system is able to capture changes in user needs in a short time.

Overall, our product combines precise information extraction methods with adaptive reinforcement learning mechanism. It goes through automated analysis of resumes and job descriptions, construct a detailed user statuses and matches are assessed in multiple dimensions, and then the model is continuously learned and adjusted in conjunction with real-time user feedback to ultimately achieve efficient, personalised job recommendations.

Part e  

The part time recruitment space in the UK is still dominated by large, horizontal job boards such as Indeed and Reed, together with professional networking sites like LinkedIn. All three list casual roles, yet their platforms were built around full time vacancies and permanent careers. Jobseekers therefore spend excessive time filtering out irrelevant ads, while small and medium sized employers shoulder rising fees for sponsored visibility or access to CV databases. More importantly, these incumbents continue to rely on static keyword matching or broad machine learning profiles. They do not learn dynamically from each click, chat, interview or completed shift, and none of them enforces a mandatory two way verification process to weed out scams or “ghost” employers.  
Our entire product is designed around short hours and flexible shift work—precisely the segment most used by students, parents returning to work and hospitality or retail SMEs. Because we cater only to this niche, every screen, metric and algorithm is optimised for it; there is no full time clutter and therefore no wasted attention.  

In practical terms that USP rests on four pillars:  
Laser focus on the segment. By excluding full time roles entirely, the app shows seekers only genuinely relevant opportunities and gives employers a concentrated talent pool rather than the usual fire hose of unsuitable applicants.  
Adaptive reinforcement learning ranking. Each view, save, application, interview and completed shift feeds immediate or delayed reward signals into the model, which then orders listings in real time. The result is continuously improving precision that static keyword filters cannot match.  
End to end trust loop. Job seekers complete ID/KYC checks; employers are crossreferenced automatically against Companies House, and all in app conversations are escrow logged to simplify dispute resolution. This dual verification sharply reduces the fraud and spam that plague mainstream boards.   
Predictable, low entry cost. A flat £10 per month subscription gives job seekers full access to matching and messaging features. Unlike the pay per placement or premium visibility charges common on incumbent sites, our pricing is transparent and acceptable to roughly sixty percent of the target audience. For employers, posting a vacancy after verification is free, removing a major barrier for local SMEs that struggle with recruitment budgets.  
By combining trust, hyper personalisation and a part time only catalogue, Part Time Match offers clear, concrete reasons for both job seekers and employers to switch.
