Introduction 

Part a and b

Our business is focused on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help streamline the job market. We currently offer one product, an app called Part Time Job Matching. Our app uses an intelligent recommendation system based on reinforcement learning, to learn the job seekers preferences and behaviour to provide a more tailored job search process. Employers can also advertise on our app for no cost, and find suitable talent tailored for their roles.

Our primary objectives with Part Time Job Matching are to help solve the big demand for part-time job opportunities in the UK, help employers find the right talent for a given role, and streamline the job seeking process for part time workers in the UK. In our business plan you will see how our product achieves all these objectives; with the way we have our designed our product. These objectives were a part of our philosophy when we were designing our product, and we believe our solution in its current form is the best way forward for both job seekers and employers.

   Our product has two types of customers. Our first type of customer are job seekers looking for part time work across the UK, whether it is the unemployed or people looking for an extra job to earn some money. These two types of customers are all split between various industries that specialize in certain skills. These two groups should be able to identify themselves easily, as we have made it clear that our product is strictly aimed at the part time job market. Furthermore, our product has the capability to differentiate the specific set of skills that each job seeker has. So, we believe that customers will have no issues identifying themselves and seeing if the product is relevant for them. Another type of customer are businesses looking for job seekers to apply for roles and hire workers. Whether it is global business who operate in the UK or local businesses looking for part time workers. This type of customer should easily be able to identify themselves and since there are no costs for businesses to advertise on our site, they should be attracted to our offerings as well. Our product also helps stop workers from applying to jobs they are not qualified for with our recommendation system making it easier for recruiters in these businesses to handle the workload they may face when posting a job role on our site. Both these types of customers are welcome to use our product, and we have made it easier on both fronts with our usage of Artificial Intelligence.

Job seekers face numerous issues when looking for all types of work and product helps alleviate most of them. One hurdle they may face is difficulty finding a suitable position given the certain skills they may have. There are multiple factors for this being a competitive job market, not being aware of potential opportunities and a mismatch between available roles and a job seekers qualification. Our product helps minimize theses issue with its recommendation system based on reinforcement learning, so job seekers will be aware of all suitable job roles based on their skills at any time. If a job seeker wants to broaden their search, they can add more skills outside their ability to even see roles that may not be 100% suited for them, this can help at times when the job market is very competitive. So, our product helps get over this hurdle that potential part time workers may face. Another barrier that job seekers may face is overwhelming job search process. There are many steps to this issue whether it is the interview process being multiple stages, writing cover letters and researching companies. While our product can not solve these issues directly it can make it easier for job seekers to not be burnt out navigating pages of job roles that may not be suitable for them. Our main feature is the intelligent recommendation system which helps browsing through job roles much less tedious for the job seeker as they will only be recommended roles that suited for them. It is more in depth than a regular search function on a job board and we will not place sponsored ads by companies on our page making it much easier to navigate than other job boards. Hence, we can help overcome potential burnout that job seekers may face when looking for work.

On the other hand, the issues that the employers face are inherently due to hiring practices that a certain employer relies on.  While our product can not solve all these issues completely it can help alleviate a few of them. Streamlining the hiring process is a key area in which our product can help with but not completely solve. The hiring process can require interviews and assessments, and both things can be scheduled with the job seeker via our in-app chat system. To be clear this is not a feature unique to us, but some job boards do not have this functionality and rely solely on email. In the potential case a job seeker does not see an email from a recruiter our app will have notifications to always alert the job seeker when the recruiter is contacting them. Finding the right talent can also be an issue that employers face, looking for the person with the right set of skills and ethos can be difficult. Due to the way our product is designed we believe that recruiters will see a greater influx of suitable talent due to the nature of our recommendation system. Job seekers will only see roles that are suitable with their given set of skills and apply for them at their own will. Hence, helping filter out applications that are a poor fit for their given set of skills, and further reducing potential time wasted.

 What is the product that will meet the needs (value proposition)?
 
Our product is a part-time job matching platform that connects local employers with suitable candidates based on their skills, availability, and location. While this approach is effective for many modern service sectors, a recent interview with a long-established barbershop in Bath—New Saville Row, operating since 1965—highlighted a crucial insight: traditional industries like barbering value not only the presence of manpower but also the quality and specificity of skills.
The barbershop expressed that they experience staffing shortages during peak times but still prefer walk-in applicants with CVs. The reason is that barbering is a hands-on profession requiring precise scissor work—skills that are often not well taught in technical schools, which focus mainly on electric clippers. Moreover, the owner emphasized that face-to-face trials are essential to evaluate a candidate’s true ability. This feedback indicates that our product, in order to serve traditional skilled industries effectively, must go beyond standard digital matching.

To meet these needs, our value proposition includes:

Customizable job posting features where employers can request specific skills (e.g., scissor cutting, wet shaving), upload requirements, or require certifications.

A portfolio system for applicants to upload videos or photos of past work, making their abilities more visible and credible.

Experience-based filters allowing businesses to indicate whether they accept beginners or require prior experience.

An optional trial shift booking system, letting employers invite shortlisted applicants for a paid trial before making a final decision.

By implementing these features, we bridge the gap between digital recruitment and the practical, skill-driven expectations of traditional employers. Our product is not only a tool for job matching but also a platform that promotes skill transparency and trust, helping ensure the right fit between job seekers and businesses—especially in industries where craftsmanship matters.
